      "number": 19,

      "number": 20,
      "content": "When they heard this, they got angry with him—just like they did with the old prophets they had thrown out, stoned, and killed. They wanted to kill him too. But I want to show you that the Lord's tender mercy protects everyone he has chosen because of their faith, making them strong enough to escape danger."
